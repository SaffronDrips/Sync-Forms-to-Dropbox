## Set-Up Instructions:

#### Before Beginning:
1. - The 'jq' bash command must be installed. If it is not installed, here's a guide for installing it. https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/#:~:text=jq%20is%20in%20the%20official,using%20sudo%20dnf%20install%20jq%20.
2. - You will need your Dropbox Forms API KEY and API Secret. Here's a guide to getting those from your Dropbox Forms Web app. Here is a guide for getting your API credentials. Here is a video guide that covers the set-up process as well: https://capture.dropbox.com/VKTEgysfDYgsU4Tn
<br> https://helloworks.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026065611-How-to-find-your-Public-Private-API-key
3. - You will need to set-up an API app in your Dropbox Console. This video shows you how to do that: https://capture.dropbox.com/zfpdbxAeOktgvieA

#### Steps:
1. Download the files in this repository. You may need to unzip them.
2. Open the credentials.txt file
3. Copy and Paste your API_KEY and API_SECRET from your Dropbox Forms Web Console beside the "=" of each credential. It should look like the example below:  <br>
      FORMS_API_KEY=123fsadas12421312  <br>
      FORMS_API_SECRET=3412312eqweqw342  <br>
4. If you would like your files to be downloaded to specific folder or a sync folder, move these files into the folder you wish to have all your completed forms downloaded in
5. Run the script. One way to do this is to open a terminal instance in your current folder and executing this command "sh bulk-download.sh"
6. Your completed forms and CSV reports will begin downloading now
7. You can see a log of all the downloaded files in the terminal
